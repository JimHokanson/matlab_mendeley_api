# Mendeley API for Matlab #

Implementation of Mendeley API in Matlab. This code base contains only the basic processing methods for the API. Higher level functions which use this code can be found in my Mendeley Code repository (TODO: Insert link).

# Current Status #

6/25/2013 - The rough basics are implemented. It is rather easy to add new methods as necessary. Currently only the methods I've needed for my code repository are implemented. More will be coming as I need them!

# Code Dependencies #

The code currently relies on some local functions. I am working to translate these into publically available versions. In addition the code also relies on the following repositories:

1. oauth (TODO: Insert Link)
2. standard library (TODO: Insert Link)
